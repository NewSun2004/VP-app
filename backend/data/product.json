From the moment I opened the sleek and eco-friendly packaging, I knew I was in for a treat. Warby Parker's attention to detail and commitment to quality were evident right from the start.\n\nFirst and foremost, the style of the glasses is impeccable. The design is modern and chic, striking the perfect balance between trendy and timeless. The wide range of frame options available made it easy for me to find a pair that suits my personal style, and the virtual try-on feature on their website was incredibly helpful in making my decision.\n\nBeyond the stylish appearance, the glasses are exceptionally comfortable to wear. The lightweight frames sit comfortably on my face, and the high-quality materials used ensure durability without compromising on comfort. The attention to ergonomics is evident, making these glasses ideal for extended wear without any discomfort.\n\nThe prescription lenses are spot on, providing crystal-clear vision with no distortions. I appreciate the anti-reflective coating, which reduces glare and enhances visual clarity, especially when using digital devices. The overall craftsmanship of the glasses reflects Warby Parker's commitment to delivering a top-notch product.\n\nWhat sets Warby Parker apart is their socially conscious business model. For every pair of glasses sold, they donate a pair to someone in need, making it a brand that not only cares about its customers but also about making a positive impact on the world. Knowing that my purchase contributes to a greater cause adds an extra layer of satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience with Warby Parker has been nothing short of fantastic. From the stylish design and comfort to the precision of the lenses and the company's commitment to social responsibility, I can confidently say that these glasses are a winning combination. I wholeheartedly recommend Warby Parker to anyone in search of quality eyewear with a touch of style and a socially conscious ethos.",

I ordered the precision progressives in the extra wide tortise Chamberlain frame.  They have been fantastic.  None of the issues I had with the old glasses.  I recently needed them adjusted and learned there was a Warby Parker store in the local mall.  I was in and out in 10 mins.  Just a fantastic experience with Warby and highly recommend.",

They are one of the first pair of glasses that I have found that look stylish on me. I also extremely appreciated the fast delivery. I was in desperate need of some replacement glasses as I’ve had mine for 10+ years and they had just broke on me. It was definitely time , but that’s why the delivery from Warby Parker was great. Another thing was how affordable they were . Most glasses are pretty expensive so I appreciated that you could get such amazing glasses at such a great price . Im in a bit of a financial hardship so it was something I really loved and appreciated about Warby parker . Also I’ve called a few times to customer service , once to find out more about Warby Parker and how it all works , and twice to compliment the service and the glasses. I want to give a huge thank you to Shannon from Tennessee. She was the first to take my call and tell me all about Warby Parker winning me over with her passion. She told me a funny story about her friend Wally and I thanked her for being so nice compared to phone operators out here in the California area. Anywho Shannon was great and so nice . She made the ordering process easy to understand and even found me a Warby parker location in Brea , CA. With that being said because Warby Parker was so genuine and has such caring , kind employees I decided this was the company I wanted to spend my money with. They really care about helping people see and just helping in general. I feel Warby Parker is a great company and I wish you had more locations out here in California because I’d love to work for you . Thanks Warby Parker for taking care of me as a customer and also being affordable and quick . 5 stars will definitely recommend to all my friends with glasses .. I get compliments on my Chamberlains all the time .",

They are one of the first pair of glasses that I have found that look stylish on me. I also extremely appreciated the fast delivery. I was in desperate need of some replacement glasses as I’ve had mine for 10+ years and they had just broke on me. It was definitely time , but that’s why the delivery from Warby Parker was great. Another thing was how affordable they were . Most glasses are pretty expensive so I appreciated that you could get such amazing glasses at such a great price . Im in a bit of a financial hardship so it was something I really loved and appreciated about Warby parker . Also I’ve called a few times to customer service , once to find out more about Warby Parker and how it all works , and twice to compliment the service and the glasses. I want to give a huge thank you to Shannon from Tennessee. She was the first to take my call and tell me all about Warby Parker winning me over with her passion. She told me a funny story about her friend Wally and I thanked her for being so nice compared to phone operators out here in the California area. Anywho Shannon was great and so nice . She made the ordering process easy to understand and even found me a Warby parker location in Brea , CA. With that being said because Warby Parker was so genuine and has such caring , kind employees I decided this was the company I wanted to spend my money with. They really care about helping people see and just helping in general. I feel Warby Parker is a great company and I wish you had more locations out here in California because I’d love to work for you . Thanks Warby Parker for taking care of me as a customer and also being affordable and quick . 5 stars will definitely recommend to all my friends with glasses .. I get compliments on my Chamberlains all the time .",

If you hold the glasses infront of you with one hand - and another pair in the other hand ... the tinting is obvious.\n\nThe tinting isnt a big deal in everyday situations like reading, working on a computer etc - but I do a good deal of photography image editing - and I have to take the Brady off and put on another pair that has a clear lens.

Try at home didn't seem to be an option, but I wanted to get them ordered anyway, so I didn't try them on first. The website did recommend a wide size for me, but I went by the numbers on my existing frames and ordered the regular fit instead. I'm glad that I did, so just know that the numbers may be more reliable than the online recommendations, depending on how you like your frames to fit. I was nervous about the PD measuring process, but it seems to have worked great as well. Overall, I'm pleased with the experience.",

They are one of the first pair of glasses that I have found that look stylish on me. I also extremely appreciated the fast delivery. I was in desperate need of some replacement glasses as I’ve had mine for 10+ years and they had just broke on me. It was definitely time , but that’s why the delivery from Warby Parker was great. Another thing was how affordable they were . Most glasses are pretty expensive so I appreciated that you could get such amazing glasses at such a great price . Im in a bit of a financial hardship so it was something I really loved and appreciated about Warby parker . Also I’ve called a few times to customer service , once to find out more about Warby Parker and how it all works , and twice to compliment the service and the glasses. I want to give a huge thank you to Shannon from Tennessee. She was the first to take my call and tell me all about Warby Parker winning me over with her passion. She told me a funny story about her friend Wally and I thanked her for being so nice compared to phone operators out here in the California area. Anywho Shannon was great and so nice . She made the ordering process easy to understand and even found me a Warby parker location in Brea , CA. With that being said because Warby Parker was so genuine and has such caring , kind employees I decided this was the company I wanted to spend my money with. They really care about helping people see and just helping in general. I feel Warby Parker is a great company and I wish you had more locations out here in California because I’d love to work for you . Thanks Warby Parker for taking care of me as a customer and also being affordable and quick . 5 stars will definitely recommend to all my friends with glasses .. I get compliments on my Chamberlains all the time .",

Prices were not nearly as low as I was expecting, but a bit lower than LensCrafters. However, I received my glasses a couple of weeks after my in-store purchase, and the alignment on the progressive lenses is way off. I guess the “look straight at me and I’ll mark your pupils with a Sharpee marker” method of alignment isn’t nearly as good as the “put this fancy gadget on your head and it will accurately measure your pupil distance” method that other places use. Now I’m going to have to go all the way back to the store (45 minute drive for me) to get them fixed, then wait another couple of weeks for the new glasses to come back in, and hope that the alignment is correct this time. So all-in-all this will be at least a two month ordeal. Frankly, next time I’m going back to LensCrafters, paying a bit more, but getting same-day turnaround and on-the-spot problem solving.

My wife and I were at the mall one day and there was an actual Warby Parker store there, so I popped in (with our two young kids!) and tried on some glasses.\n\nThe store employees were so great!  They let my young daughters try on glasses (as they were running around the store).  They were super helpful for me too -- directing me to the type of frames I wanted.\n\nAll in all I found my glasses super quickly and paid for them right there.  I subsequently went to get my eyes checked at a different place and sent in the Rx for my eyes.  My insurance (VSP) even covered $70 of the $95 price!",

A local store would have charged more and would not have taken back glasses that already had my prescription lenses them.  Can't say enough good about my experience.

My friends and family have all complimented me wearing them. Originally, I went to my eye doctor inquiring about their cost of lenses and frames. The prescription alone would have cost me $600 not including frames. I just couldn't justify spending that amount of money. My niece recommended Warby Parker, and there is a store in Wesley Chapel, Florida where I live. I prefer trying on frames in person, so I was very excited. They were so helpful and took the time to select a number of frames that would go well with the shape of my face. My old frames were always a little too wide.  The sales associate at Warby Parker took that into account when helping me select my frames. The store was also very clean and the sample frames were in top shape. Other optical places I visited did not have that personal customer service like Warby Parker and they weren't as clean either. Since sharing my experience and the cost savings with others, two of my friends have decided to visit Warby Parker.",

Also, there were so many people in the store and the person just really rushed me and they were trying to help five people at once, and I just felt very anxious there  , Due to the quick and callous workers that maybe they were just overworked. I wish I could trade my frame in for the pair that I tried on in the store though,  I’m just not happy with these. They’re just kind of boring looking.

This time, there were a couple of missteps which I found very frustrating, given WPs favorable customer service.\n1) I returned my Try-On package to my local store and ordered one of the pairs from the box. The WP associate marked the lenses with the red dots and they submitted the order. A few days later, that very same box, including the sample pair with the red dots, was delivered to my house and I had to once again bring it down to the store. It took a while for the associates to understand what had happened, but eventually they got it.\n2) Even though my previous orders said delivery in 7-10 business days, my glasses always arrived earlier than expected. This time, however, my order took 2 weeks (14 business days) to arrive. It was frustrating because I had ordered the glasses in time for a scheduled work trip, but they were delivered late.\nI will probably still order from Warby Parker...your associates are always very friendly and professional, and the mix-up with the sample try-ons was not a big deal. I'm hoping that the delayed delivery was a fluke.\nJust wanted to give you feedback from a loyal customer.",

I knew I wanted something different and cute so I decided to give WarbyParker a chance since I always go into their store and try out their selection. I love how their employees made sure I made the wise decision to select my new pair of glasses. The whole experience was smooth and easy, and my glasses feel amazing. Even though I didn't get my prescription from WarbyParker, they still guided me through their warranty process and prescription process. It's about to be a month with my new pair and I love the new look it gave me for the new year. Def worth purchasing from them!",

The price was impressive with progressive lenses at less than half at the frame shop attached to my eye doctor.  That was great until I received the finished the package with CLEAR FRAMES (not even looked at) but I thought I would give them a TRY.  After a while my wife of 56 years said she did not like the frames and I agreed.  But then fate stepped in as I was working in my shop and a project broke, I fell face first on to the concrete floor and now I need a replacement in the DARK GREY-GREEN color but how does that happen?

There is not nearby Warby Parker store so I went to a local eye doctor.  They tried to sell me glasses for well over $1,000.  I decided to buy a few pairs online instead.  I read reviews that said another site, other than Warby Parker, was the best so I ordered one pair from them and one pair from Warby Parker (having heard about Warby Parker from the TV series, 'Vida').  The glasses I ordered from the other online retailer are famous designer glasses but they were more expensive and quite frankly hurt my nose, the ones I received from Warby Parker are much more comfortable and I like the way they look on me.  Part of this is because Warby Parker sent me a box of five pairs to try on before I ordered.  This made making a decision easier.  I am very happy with my Warby Parkers and I will be back next time I need glasses.  I have sone suggestion, one area of improvement would be to increase from 5 to 10 pairs.",

I then went in to get them adjusted so they wouldn't slide off my face.  The employee simply looked behind my ear and without any input from me, made huge adjustments to them making them very tight.  I did ask him to  readjusted back some, but after more wear, I find they are still too tight and unwearable.  He didn't listen well or ask a single question about how I would want them adjusted.  Now I am frustrated that I have to go back in for a fourth time... Overall, I think it is hit or miss as far as who you are working with in the store.

The store on The Plaza had so many choices to look at. \nOnce I had the frames chosen, Yanis asked if I needed an exam. I did not, Yanis told me that was not a problem, as the company would contact my optometrist and get the prescription. I now have my glasses and I am so pleased with them.",

My collie pup chewed up my first pair so I went to a local shop to hopefully get another pair fast and was disappointed. Partly my fault, because I didn’t realize a smaller lens would mean a smaller area for each part of the progressive. But I also thought a professional fitting would mean better performance and it didn’t. I’m happier with my Warby Parker lens. My only complaint is that my last pair didn’t hug my head as well as I would have liked but hopefully we’ll have a Warby Parker storefront soon and I can get adjustments there. In the meantime I’ll have to order another pair because my collie just ate the glasses I bought to replace the first pair—sure am glad Warby Parker is cheaper than the local guys.",

We try to support our neighborhood stores and are repeat customers. Like before, the product is excellent. Unfortunately, this time around we experienced zero follow up customer service. The fit for my glasses were loose and when I asked they be tightened was told only an optometrist could do that. Next, I was told when I bought my frames, that they would arrange for a previous Warby Parker purchase to be sent to Las Vegas and have its lenses replaced with my current ones and that it would be a two week turnaround. When I asked them to make those arrangements was told that only an optometrist could do that. I can't imagine two more basic customer service requests than that. My question is were they untrained sales people or is there no longer a customer service at Warby Parker?",

Imagine my dismay when I was unable to see with them! I returned to my eye doctor to make sure they were made correctly (which they 100% were). Upon receiving a new exam, the doctor determined that the first prescription was in error and wrote a new one. Thinking I was now stuck with $300 worth of glasses I couldn't use, I called Warby Parker to see what could be done. Their reply? \"No problem. Just bring in your glasses and new prescription and we will replace the lenses at no cost.\" Who does that in today's world? I am a Warby Parker fan for life!",

In the process of ordering the new frames they charged the wrong credit card and it took me like 6 emails and a few calls to sort everything down.

Try at home didn't seem to be an option, but I wanted to get them ordered anyway, so I didn't try them on first. The website did recommend a wide size for me, but I went by the numbers on my existing frames and ordered the regular fit instead. I'm glad that I did, so just know that the numbers may be more reliable than the online recommendations, depending on how you like your frames to fit. I was nervous about the PD measuring process, but it seems to have worked great as well. Overall, I'm pleased with the experience.",

From the moment I opened the sleek and eco-friendly packaging, I knew I was in for a treat. Warby Parker's attention to detail and commitment to quality were evident right from the start.\n\nFirst and foremost, the style of the glasses is impeccable. The design is modern and chic, striking the perfect balance between trendy and timeless. The wide range of frame options available made it easy for me to find a pair that suits my personal style, and the virtual try-on feature on their website was incredibly helpful in making my decision.\n\nBeyond the stylish appearance, the glasses are exceptionally comfortable to wear. The lightweight frames sit comfortably on my face, and the high-quality materials used ensure durability without compromising on comfort. The attention to ergonomics is evident, making these glasses ideal for extended wear without any discomfort.\n\nThe prescription lenses are spot on, providing crystal-clear vision with no distortions. I appreciate the anti-reflective coating, which reduces glare and enhances visual clarity, especially when using digital devices. The overall craftsmanship of the glasses reflects Warby Parker's commitment to delivering a top-notch product.\n\nWhat sets Warby Parker apart is their socially conscious business model. For every pair of glasses sold, they donate a pair to someone in need, making it a brand that not only cares about its customers but also about making a positive impact on the world. Knowing that my purchase contributes to a greater cause adds an extra layer of satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience with Warby Parker has been nothing short of fantastic. From the stylish design and comfort to the precision of the lenses and the company's commitment to social responsibility, I can confidently say that these glasses are a winning combination. I wholeheartedly recommend Warby Parker to anyone in search of quality eyewear with a touch of style and a socially conscious ethos.",

I ordered the precision progressives in the extra wide tortise Chamberlain frame.  They have been fantastic.  None of the issues I had with the old glasses.

They are one of the first pair of glasses that I have found that look stylish on me. I also extremely appreciated the fast delivery. I was in desperate need of some replacement glasses as I’ve had mine for 10+ years and they had just broke on me. It was definitely time , but that’s why the delivery from Warby Parker was great. Another thing was how affordable they were . Most glasses are pretty expensive so I appreciated that you could get such amazing glasses at such a great price . Im in a bit of a financial hardship so it was something I really loved and appreciated about Warby parker . Also I’ve called a few times to customer service , once to find out more about Warby Parker and how it all works , and twice to compliment the service and the glasses. I want to give a huge thank you to Shannon from Tennessee. She was the first to take my call and tell me all about Warby Parker winning me over with her passion. She told me a funny story about her friend Wally and I thanked her for being so nice compared to phone operators out here in the California area. Anywho Shannon was great and so nice . She made the ordering process easy to understand and even found me a Warby parker location in Brea , CA. With that being said because Warby Parker was so genuine and has such caring , kind employees I decided this was the company I wanted to spend my money with. They really care about helping people see and just helping in general. I feel Warby Parker is a great company and I wish you had more locations out here in California because I’d love to work for you . Thanks Warby Parker for taking care of me as a customer and also being affordable and quick . 5 stars will definitely recommend to all my friends with glasses .. I get compliments on my Chamberlains all the time .",

Prices were not nearly as low as I was expecting, but a bit lower than LensCrafters. However, I received my glasses a couple of weeks after my in-store purchase, and the alignment on the progressive lenses is way off. I guess the “look straight at me and I’ll mark your pupils with a Sharpee marker” method of alignment isn’t nearly as good as the “put this fancy gadget on your head and it will accurately measure your pupil distance” method that other places use. Now I’m going to have to go all the way back to the store (45 minute drive for me) to get them fixed, then wait another couple of weeks for the new glasses to come back in, and hope that the alignment is correct this time. So all-in-all this will be at least a two month ordeal. Frankly, next time I’m going back to LensCrafters, paying a bit more, but getting same-day turnaround and on-the-spot problem solving.

Try at home didn't seem to be an option, but I wanted to get them ordered anyway, so I didn't try them on first. The website did recommend a wide size for me, but I went by the numbers on my existing frames and ordered the regular fit instead. I'm glad that I did, so just know that the numbers may be more reliable than the online recommendations, depending on how you like your frames to fit. I was nervous about the PD measuring process, but it seems to have worked great as well. Overall, I'm pleased with the experience.",

I ordered the precision progressives in the extra wide tortise Chamberlain frame.  They have been fantastic.  None of the issues I had with the old glasses.

They are one of the first pair of glasses that I have found that look stylish on me. I also extremely appreciated the fast delivery. I was in desperate need of some replacement glasses as I’ve had mine for 10+ years and they had just broke on me. It was definitely time , but that’s why the delivery from Warby Parker was great. Another thing was how affordable they were . Most glasses are pretty expensive so I appreciated that you could get such amazing glasses at such a great price . Im in a bit of a financial hardship so it was something I really loved and appreciated about Warby parker . Also I’ve called a few times to customer service , once to find out more about Warby Parker and how it all works , and twice to compliment the service and the glasses. I want to give a huge thank you to Shannon from Tennessee. She was the first to take my call and tell me all about Warby Parker winning me over with her passion. She told me a funny story about her friend Wally and I thanked her for being so nice compared to phone operators out here in the California area. Anywho Shannon was great and so nice . She made the ordering process easy to understand and even found me a Warby parker location in Brea , CA. With that being said because Warby Parker was so genuine and has such caring , kind employees I decided this was the company I wanted to spend my money with. They really care about helping people see and just helping in general. I feel Warby Parker is a great company and I wish you had more locations out here in California because I’d love to work for you . Thanks Warby Parker for taking care of me as a customer and also being affordable and quick . 5 stars will definitely recommend to all my friends with glasses .. I get compliments on my Chamberlains all the time .",

Prices were not nearly as low as I was expecting, but a bit lower than LensCrafters. However, I received my glasses a couple of weeks after my in-store purchase, and the alignment on the progressive lenses is way off. I guess the “look straight at me and I’ll mark your pupils with a Sharpee marker” method of alignment isn’t nearly as good as the “put this fancy gadget on your head and it will accurately measure your pupil distance” method that other places use. Now I’m going to have to go all the way back to the store (45 minute drive for me) to get them fixed, then wait another couple of weeks for the new glasses to come back in, and hope that the alignment is correct this time. So all-in-all this will be at least a two month ordeal. Frankly, next time I’m going back to LensCrafters, paying a bit more, but getting same-day turnaround and on-the-spot problem solving. I gave Warby Parker a try, but I won’t be coming to them for my next pair, since they didn’t get it right the first time.",

I emailed them again about this twice and didn’t receive a response. I cannot drive or see without my glasses. Worried that they’re going to pop out completely or break, I have to go elsewhere and order another pair of glasses that are done right.

My wife and I were at the mall one day and there was an actual Warby Parker store there, so I popped in (with our two young kids!) and tried on some glasses.\n\nThe store employees were so great!  They let my young daughters try on glasses (as they were running around the store).  They were super helpful for me too -- directing me to the type of frames I wanted.\n\nAll in all I found my glasses super quickly and paid for them right there.  I subsequently went to get my eyes checked at a different place and sent in the Rx for my eyes.  My insurance (VSP) even covered $70 of the $95 price!",

My friends and family have all complimented me wearing them. Originally, I went to my eye doctor inquiring about their cost of lenses and frames. The prescription alone would have cost me $600 not including frames. I just couldn't justify spending that amount of money. My niece recommended Warby Parker, and there is a store in Wesley Chapel, Florida where I live. I prefer trying on frames in person, so I was very excited. They were so helpful and took the time to select a number of frames that would go well with the shape of my face. My old frames were always a little too wide.  The sales associate at Warby Parker took that into account when helping me select my frames. The store was also very clean and the sample frames were in top shape. Other optical places I visited did not have that personal customer service like Warby Parker and they weren't as clean either. Since sharing my experience and the cost savings with others, two of my friends have decided to visit Warby Parker.",

Also, there were so many people in the store and the person just really rushed me and they were trying to help five people at once, and I just felt very anxious there  , Due to the quick and callous workers that maybe they were just overworked. I wish I could trade my frame in for the pair that I tried on in the store though,  I’m just not happy with these. They’re just kind of boring looking.

I would have just gone into the store and tried on unlimited frames versus only 5, and been limited to the frames available for home try on, because it is very limited. \n\nMy glasses were done in a decent time frame, but I have had these a month now (past the return window) and I am still experiencing blurriness and eye strain and headaches. I know this may not completely be WP's faultt, and more to do with my prescription. But my prescription barely changed according to my doctor and this is not my first rodeo, being a glasses wearer for more than 20 years, I know what to expect when adjusting to new glasses. \n\nThe frames are beautiful and I really want to like my pair but I'll have to think hard about buying from WB again, honestly.

This process had me pare down my choices and prevented me from being overwhelmed when I entered the store. I was fairly certain I knew what I wanted and made one change before ordering a pair of regular and sunglasses. The 15% discount was a big incentive as well. The sales people were very helpful and took their time with me. Even called my doctor to double check on the script when a question came up.",

I received my home try on order quickly & with the help of a friend & a glass of wine, chose “Blakely”.  Once ordered, my new glasses came quickly and are more comfortable than any other glasses I’ve ever tried.  I’m getting nothing but sincere compliments.  Everyone LOVES the color and says they are “me”.   Way to go Warby Parker!!!  Also love that someone else will receive a pair of glasses because if my purchase.  Win Win!🤩",

This time, there were a couple of missteps which I found very frustrating, given WPs favorable customer service.\n1) I returned my Try-On package to my local store and ordered one of the pairs from the box. The WP associate marked the lenses with the red dots and they submitted the order. A few days later, that very same box, including the sample pair with the red dots, was delivered to my house and I had to once again bring it down to the store. It took a while for the associates to understand what had happened, but eventually they got it.\n2) Even though my previous orders said delivery in 7-10 business days, my glasses always arrived earlier than expected. This time, however, my order took 2 weeks (14 business days) to arrive. It was frustrating because I had ordered the glasses in time for a scheduled work trip, but they were delivered late.\nI will probably still order from Warby Parker...your associates are always very friendly and professional, and the mix-up with the sample try-ons was not a big deal. I'm hoping that the delayed delivery was a fluke.\nJust wanted to give you feedback from a loyal customer.",

The price was impressive with progressive lenses at less than half at the frame shop attached to my eye doctor.  That was great until I received the finished the package with CLEAR FRAMES (not even looked at) but I thought I would give them a TRY.  After a while my wife of 56 years said she did not like the frames and I agreed.  But then fate stepped in as I was working in my shop and a project broke, I fell face first on to the concrete floor and now I need a replacement in the DARK GREY-GREEN color but how does that happen?

There is not nearby Warby Parker store so I went to a local eye doctor.  They tried to sell me glasses for well over $1,000.  I decided to buy a few pairs online instead.  I read reviews that said another site, other than Warby Parker, was the best so I ordered one pair from them and one pair from Warby Parker (having heard about Warby Parker from the TV series, 'Vida').  The glasses I ordered from the other online retailer are famous designer glasses but they were more expensive and quite frankly hurt my nose, the ones I received from Warby Parker are much more comfortable and I like the way they look on me.  Part of this is because Warby Parker sent me a box of five pairs to try on before I ordered.  This made making a decision easier.  I am very happy with my Warby Parkers and I will be back next time I need glasses.  I have sone suggestion, one area of improvement would be to increase from 5 to 10 pairs.",

I then went in to get them adjusted so they wouldn't slide off my face.  The employee simply looked behind my ear and without any input from me, made huge adjustments to them making them very tight.  I did ask him to  readjusted back some, but after more wear, I find they are still too tight and unwearable.  He didn't listen well or ask a single question about how I would want them adjusted.  Now I am frustrated that I have to go back in for a fourth time... Overall, I think it is hit or miss as far as who you are working with in the store.

My collie pup chewed up my first pair so I went to a local shop to hopefully get another pair fast and was disappointed. Partly my fault, because I didn’t realize a smaller lens would mean a smaller area for each part of the progressive. But I also thought a professional fitting would mean better performance and it didn’t. I’m happier with my Warby Parker lens. My only complaint is that my last pair didn’t hug my head as well as I would have liked but hopefully we’ll have a Warby Parker storefront soon and I can get adjustments there. In the meantime I’ll have to order another pair because my collie just ate the glasses I bought to replace the first pair—sure am glad Warby Parker is cheaper than the local guys.",

The fit for my glasses were loose and when I asked they be tightened was told only an optometrist could do that. Next, I was told when I bought my frames, that they would arrange for a previous Warby Parker purchase to be sent to Las Vegas and have its lenses replaced with my current ones and that it would be a two week turnaround.

Imagine my dismay when I was unable to see with them! I returned to my eye doctor to make sure they were made correctly (which they 100% were). Upon receiving a new exam, the doctor determined that the first prescription was in error and wrote a new one. Thinking I was now stuck with $300 worth of glasses I couldn't use, I called Warby Parker to see what could be done. Their reply? \"No problem. Just bring in your glasses and new prescription and we will replace the lenses at no cost.\" Who does that in today's world? I am a Warby Parker fan for life!",

Try at home didn't seem to be an option, but I wanted to get them ordered anyway, so I didn't try them on first. The website did recommend a wide size for me, but I went by the numbers on my existing frames and ordered the regular fit instead. I'm glad that I did, so just know that the numbers may be more reliable than the online recommendations, depending on how you like your frames to fit. I was nervous about the PD measuring process, but it seems to have worked great as well. Overall, I'm pleased with the experience.",

                    "review_text": "This is my first experience with online eyeglasses shopping and I love the Warby Parker experience. First of all, choosing lenses was enhanced by virtual try-on, which encouraged and taught me what shapes worked best for my face. Second, the free option to try on five frames at home allowed me to narrow down the choices even further.  Instructions that came with the frames gave me more information on how to judge which ones were best for my face.  I was able to decide between regular lenses in one pair, plus Rx sunglasses, or else clear lenses with transition darkening. I chose the latter.  Then, it was so easy to return the frames. Note, in my town, the USPS carriers won’t pick up parcels from homes, if they are not scheduled beforehand, but it was easy to drop off at the PO. \nNext step, ordering was easy, because I could send a photo of my prescription that I took with my phone. The order was completed with only one extra step because the PD, pupillary distance, was unclear on the copy of the Rx that I had. I could do that step with my phone, though. I was delighted that they were able to connect with my vision insurance immediately, even though my coverage was so new I didn’t even have my ID card yet. I paid through PayPal, again easy. Finally, communication with them by email and online was clear, swift, easy, and professional. I heard by email each step of the way. Shipping was swift and tracking steps were announced. The glasses arrived safely and work very well. I bought elsewhere some polarized sunglasses that fit over these, because the transition ones darken only before getting in the car, but those other ones work even better over them inside the car glass. I’m having the best of all options for me this way, rather than separate eyeglasses and Rx sunglasses to carry around.  The glasses look good, as well. Learning to use the new Rx, putting the extra car shades over top didn’t take long to get used to. I can see so well with these that I’ll use the Warby Parker service gladly in the future and will recommend it highly.",

Try at home didn't seem to be an option, but I wanted to get them ordered anyway, so I didn't try them on first. The website did recommend a wide size for me, but I went by the numbers on my existing frames and ordered the regular fit instead. I'm glad that I did, so just know that the numbers may be more reliable than the online recommendations, depending on how you like your frames to fit. I was nervous about the PD measuring process, but it seems to have worked great as well. Overall, I'm pleased with the experience.",

Emily helped me find the perfect fit since I had to see myself in these glasses a lot! Then I had them sent to another store in another state cuz of travel. Since Itgese were my first pair they insisted I was fitted properly and show how to use them. The salesperson in the next store was as if not more knowledgeable. She showed me how to move my head to see properly thru these glasses. She took a lot of time for a proper fit. Getting used to progressive lenses isn’t easy. But I do like the frames. Have received many compliments. My only complaint is that they also are transitional lens but they are just not dark enough. So next time I’ll do glasses and a pair of sunglasses. The stores are loaded with many frames. Frames are categorized by fit. I will definitely go back to Warby Parker for my glasses and highly recommend them for service, price and product.",

No matter how many frames I tried on, I kept going back to the Santiago Hudson Blue Fade.  They are  amazing, I feel and look beautiful and the person that helped was fantastic, he just allowed me to take my time, try on as many frames as I wanted, answered all my questions, he was just the absolute person to work with.  He had great feed back, I felt so comfortable with deciding and making my purchase.

I think due to the shape of the frame, your eyes hit very high on the lenses so you HAVE to do an individual PD read for these particular frames because the one on your Rx will be crap. Which confuses me as to why mine is crap because I went in-person and their employee took the measurements while I had frames on but I think because I had to then upload the Rx I left in the car, the software on the site must have reverted to the paper Rx’s PD. Idk. Just be forewarned. I have to return these before the 30-day window lapses. So disappointed. Also, I always get plastic frames…so maybe all metal arms are this flimsy??…but I feel like I’m going to break them whenever I open & close the arms as I take them on & off. They feel like kids’ “pretend” glasses…the opposite of any other Warby Parker frame I’ve ever owned. I’ll exchange for an all plastic frame though, it hasn’t completely scared me away! Lol",

I made an appointment with the Optometrist for a week later.  The appointment was disappointing because she didn’t have time to dilate my eyes and said she would when I came back to pick up my 2 pair of glasses in “10 days or less.”  My glasses took three weeks, I called to ask if I could come in to have them adjusted, told the girl about the dilation and she said to just come in.  I went in a couple of days later and asked about the dilation and they said they couldn’t do it.  I waited a while and someone came over to adjust my glasses.  I am sorry to say, they just do not fit correctly and, at this point, I don’t know what I’m going to do.",

I have to say that is the biggest disadvantage of not using a one stop shop. No recourse and not easily checked. I travel a lot and don’t have the ability to bounce back and forth to get it sorted out.

My friends and family have all complimented me wearing them. Originally, I went to my eye doctor inquiring about their cost of lenses and frames. The prescription alone would have cost me $600 not including frames. I just couldn't justify spending that amount of money. My niece recommended Warby Parker, and there is a store in Wesley Chapel, Florida where I live. I prefer trying on frames in person, so I was very excited. They were so helpful and took the time to select a number of frames that would go well with the shape of my face. My old frames were always a little too wide.  The sales associate at Warby Parker took that into account when helping me select my frames. The store was also very clean and the sample frames were in top shape. Other optical places I visited did not have that personal customer service like Warby Parker and they weren't as clean either. Since sharing my experience and the cost savings with others, two of my friends have decided to visit Warby Parker.",

The pair I got actually just seems like tortoise with one or two little specks of pink on The arm that’s basically above my ear and no one even sees it and they’re not as fun and pretty as the pair I tried on. Also, there were so many people in the store and the person just really rushed me and they were trying to help five people at once, and I just felt very anxious there  , Due to the quick and callous workers that maybe they were just overworked. I wish I could trade my frame in for the pair that I tried on in the store though,  I’m just not happy with these. They’re just kind of boring looking. And my interest in Warby Parker is how fun and their frames are, and I just feel the ones I got look and seem average.",

I went to the store and picked out the frames. Would have been nice if the sales associate let me know there were other colors available at the time of purchase and the temple lengths.  I originally picked out the Hector frames for daily use, however they only came with a 145 temple length which wrapped around my ear.

My friends and family have all complimented me wearing them. Originally, I went to my eye doctor inquiring about their cost of lenses and frames. The prescription alone would have cost me $600 not including frames. I just couldn't justify spending that amount of money. My niece recommended Warby Parker, and there is a store in Wesley Chapel, Florida where I live. I prefer trying on frames in person, so I was very excited. They were so helpful and took the time to select a number of frames that would go well with the shape of my face. My old frames were always a little too wide.  The sales associate at Warby Parker took that into account when helping me select my frames. The store was also very clean and the sample frames were in top shape. Other optical places I visited did not have that personal customer service like Warby Parker and they weren't as clean either. Since sharing my experience and the cost savings with others, two of my friends have decided to visit Warby Parker.",

Also, there were so many people in the store and the person just really rushed me and they were trying to help five people at once, and I just felt very anxious there  , Due to the quick and callous workers that maybe they were just overworked. I wish I could trade my frame in for the pair that I tried on in the store though,  I’m just not happy with these. They’re just kind of boring looking.

At this point it is not about the numbers.  I have been very impressed with Warby Parkers business model of donating a pair for every pair purchased.  I shared that fact with anyone who wondered where to go.  Unfortunately this experience has shown me that your philanthropy is carried on the shoulders of your customers and how you value your customers (and wonder about your employees) lacks the appreciation that they deserve.  For what is a company without its customers?   Regrettably,  I am no longer a customer.",

A few greens in there as well. So, I thought I'd step a little outside my comfort zone and try a bit of a different color and a more pronounced, textural frame with the Javier in Brown Sugar Crystal. While at first I was really unsure of the color as I thought it might not work well with my very pale, ginger complexion and hair but I guess I just have no idea what looks good because every single time I wear them I get multiple compliments on the really interesting look of the frame as well as the color! So, I def recommend them, they really are pretty rad looking with the geometric diamond cuts on the face front and the bold silhouette. Most of my WP frames, as in probably 20 of 23 pairs are a medium fit, however I am a smidge on the narrow end of a medium so this frame which is a smidge on the wider end of medium is one I did need to have a couple of adjustments on to get it fitting just right. Nothing major and it was certainly doable by a WP optician but in case anyone out there with a solidly narrow face is looking at this frame, it will probably just be a little too big and might not be a great option.",

A few greens in there as well. So, I thought I'd step a little outside my comfort zone and try a bit of a different color and a more pronounced, textural frame with the Javier in Brown Sugar Crystal. While at first I was really unsure of the color as I thought it might not work well with my very pale, ginger complexion and hair but I guess I just have no idea what looks good because every single time I wear them I get multiple compliments on the really interesting look of the frame as well as the color! So, I def recommend them, they really are pretty rad looking with the geometric diamond cuts on the face front and the bold silhouette. Most of my WP frames, as in probably 20 of 23 pairs are a medium fit, however I am a smidge on the narrow end of a medium so this frame which is a smidge on the wider end of medium is one I did need to have a couple of adjustments on to get it fitting just right. Nothing major and it was certainly doable by a WP optician but in case anyone out there with a solidly narrow face is looking at this frame, it will probably just be a little too big and might not be a great option.",

We try to support our neighborhood stores and are repeat customers. Like before, the product is excellent. Unfortunately, this time around we experienced zero follow up customer service. The fit for my glasses were loose and when I asked they be tightened was told only an optometrist could do that. Next, I was told when I bought my frames, that they would arrange for a previous Warby Parker purchase to be sent to Las Vegas and have its lenses replaced with my current ones and that it would be a two week turnaround. When I asked them to make those arrangements was told that only an optometrist could do that. I can't imagine two more basic customer service requests than that. My question is were they untrained sales people or is there no longer a customer service at Warby Parker?",

However, it soon became a comedy of small errors that made the overall experience regretful. \n\nFirst off, I ordered two glasses and the shipping department sent one my glasses to a location in the USA - my friend was able to forward them but I was assured at the store that both pairs would reach me in Canada. Second, one of my pairs of glasses was a completely wrong size (wide) when the other pair was correct (medium). Third, when I got the wide pair and got them fitted at a different retailer in Canada, I was told by an optician that the combination of my thick lens and the moulded frame (not metal) was not recommended because even though they could be adjusted by bending the frame, they explained that, over time, the frame would 'bounce back' to its original shape - making them unwearable. \n\nThe shipping experience was bad. I first contacted WP's support to inquire when I was getting into the fourth week without receiving my glasses - I was told it was still within their 'window' for delivery even though the tracking shown that it was in New York as 'processing' for 3 weeks. I had to contact them again when I realized they would not make their window, the second support person I contacted was much more helpful in figuring out that my medium glasses had gone astray in shipping. He corrected the issue by re-issuing my order (which took another 3 weeks to get to me). So, when it came to the wide pair, the glasses were obviously not going to work for me, I contacted support again to see what could be done. Due to the issue of me being in Canada, ordering from the USA, they recommended that I send the wide pair back for a refund. However, the shipping department (or a computer) did not take this into account and they sent me a return label as if I was in the USA (postage paid for the US Postal system). I had to contact them again to get a re-issue for my return label to send through a Canadian carrier.\n\nAs I said, the overall impression of Warby Parker was one in which their employees would try to help as best they could but I can honestly say that I won't consider going through them again. Unless, I do it locally (but that is obviously up to the cost they would charge for glasses in Canada - FYI, prescription glasses in Canada are burdensomely expensive compared to other markets). I know that my experience was unique but I sending this on with the hopes that things improve (and urge them to open a store in Calgary, Alberta).",

Since then, they haven't just become an accessory; they've become an extension of my confidence and personal style. Let me tell you why:\n\nIt's no secret that feeling good about how you look translates to feeling good about yourself. And let me tell you, these Abe frames are confidence rocket fuel. Every time I catch my reflection, I see a man who means business, someone who exudes both style and substance. It's a subtle shift, but it makes all the difference.\n\nThe beauty of the Abe frames lies in their disarming simplicity. No unnecessary frills, no gaudy embellishments – just classic elegance that enhances my persona without overpowering it. They seamlessly blend with my personal style, adding a touch of sophistication without ever feeling out of place.\n\n Finding glasses that fit well can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. But the Abe frames? They're a match made in heaven. The weight is perfectly balanced, the shape flatters my face, and the fit is snug yet comfortable. It's like they were custom-designed for me!\n\nThese frames are more than just a way to correct my vision; they're an investment in myself. The quality is impeccable, and the Warby Parker experience, from browsing online to visiting the store, was exceptional. The entire journey was smooth, informative, and enjoyable.\n\nIt's been two months, and my love for these Abe frames hasn't wavered. They're a testament to the power of classic design, exceptional quality, and a perfect fit.",

A friend of mine had a good experience and said that I could avoid hassle and high costs through this retailer. \nI should also preface that every individual that helped me genuinely tried their best to help me through the process. However, it soon became a comedy of small errors that made the overall experience regretful. \n\nFirst off, I ordered two glasses and the shipping department sent one my glasses to a location in the USA - my friend was able to forward them but I was assured at the store that both pairs would reach me in Canada. Second, one of my pairs of glasses was a completely wrong size (wide) when the other pair was correct (medium). Third, when I got the wide pair and got them fitted at a different retailer in Canada, I was told by an optician that the combination of my thick lens and the moulded frame (not metal) was not recommended because even though they could be adjusted by bending the frame, they explained that, over time, the frame would 'bounce back' to its original shape - making them unwearable. \n\nThe shipping experience was bad. I first contacted WP's support to inquire when I was getting into the fourth week without receiving my glasses - I was told it was still within their 'window' for delivery even though the tracking shown that it was in New York as 'processing' for 3 weeks. I had to contact them again when I realized they would not make their window, the second support person I contacted was much more helpful in figuring out that my medium glasses had gone astray in shipping. He corrected the issue by re-issuing my order (which took another 3 weeks to get to me). So, when it came to the wide pair, the glasses were obviously not going to work for me, I contacted support again to see what could be done. Due to the issue of me being in Canada, ordering from the USA, they recommended that I send the wide pair back for a refund. However, the shipping department (or a computer) did not take this into account and they sent me a return label as if I was in the USA (postage paid for the US Postal system). I had to contact them again to get a re-issue for my return label to send through a Canadian carrier.\n\nAs I said, the overall impression of Warby Parker was one in which their employees would try to help as best they could but I can honestly say that I won't consider going through them again. Unless, I do it locally (but that is obviously up to the cost they would charge for glasses in Canada - FYI, prescription glasses in Canada are burdensomely expensive compared to other markets). I know that my experience was unique but I sending this on with the hopes that things improve (and urge them to open a store in Calgary, Alberta).",

Since then, they haven't just become an accessory; they've become an extension of my confidence and personal style. Let me tell you why:\n\nIt's no secret that feeling good about how you look translates to feeling good about yourself. And let me tell you, these Abe frames are confidence rocket fuel. Every time I catch my reflection, I see a man who means business, someone who exudes both style and substance. It's a subtle shift, but it makes all the difference.\n\nThe beauty of the Abe frames lies in their disarming simplicity. No unnecessary frills, no gaudy embellishments – just classic elegance that enhances my persona without overpowering it. They seamlessly blend with my personal style, adding a touch of sophistication without ever feeling out of place.\n\n Finding glasses that fit well can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. But the Abe frames? They're a match made in heaven. The weight is perfectly balanced, the shape flatters my face, and the fit is snug yet comfortable. It's like they were custom-designed for me!\n\nThese frames are more than just a way to correct my vision; they're an investment in myself. The quality is impeccable, and the Warby Parker experience, from browsing online to visiting the store, was exceptional. The entire journey was smooth, informative, and enjoyable.\n\nIt's been two months, and my love for these Abe frames hasn't wavered. They're a testament to the power of classic design, exceptional quality, and a perfect fit.",

However, it was the exemplary service provided by the sales associate that truly made my experience unforgettable.\n\nAs someone with a narrower face, finding the perfect pair of glasses has always been a bit of a challenge. But the sales associate, whose name escapes me in my sheer delight, went above and beyond to ensure that I not only found frames that fit snugly but also resonated with my personality.\n\nHer knowledge of the product line was impressive, and she expertly guided me through the selection process, considering not just the fit but also the style that best suited me. She patiently listened to my preferences and concerns, offering valuable insights and suggestions along the way.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the genuine care and attention she showed throughout our interaction. It wasn't just about making a sale; it was about forging a connection and ensuring that I walked away completely satisfied. Their enthusiasm for their work was palpable, and it made the entire experience enjoyable and memorable.\n\nThanks to her guidance, I found a pair of narrow frames that not only complemented my face shape but also reflected my individuality. Such personalized service is rare in today's retail landscape, and the sales associate Mary deserves the highest praise for that.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to Warby Parker was elevated to an exceptional level thanks to the incredible assistance provided by the sales associate. Her professionalism, expertise, and genuine kindness made all the difference, and I will undoubtedly be returning for all my eyewear needs in the future. If you're in search of the perfect pair of glasses, look no further than Warby Parker, where exceptional service by Mary awaits.",

However, it was the exemplary service provided by the sales associate that truly made my experience unforgettable.\n\nAs someone with a narrower face, finding the perfect pair of glasses has always been a bit of a challenge. But the sales associate, whose name escapes me in my sheer delight, went above and beyond to ensure that I not only found frames that fit snugly but also resonated with my personality.\n\nHer knowledge of the product line was impressive, and she expertly guided me through the selection process, considering not just the fit but also the style that best suited me. She patiently listened to my preferences and concerns, offering valuable insights and suggestions along the way.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the genuine care and attention she showed throughout our interaction. It wasn't just about making a sale; it was about forging a connection and ensuring that I walked away completely satisfied. Their enthusiasm for their work was palpable, and it made the entire experience enjoyable and memorable.\n\nThanks to her guidance, I found a pair of narrow frames that not only complemented my face shape but also reflected my individuality. Such personalized service is rare in today's retail landscape, and the sales associate Mary deserves the highest praise for that.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to Warby Parker was elevated to an exceptional level thanks to the incredible assistance provided by the sales associate. Her professionalism, expertise, and genuine kindness made all the difference, and I will undoubtedly be returning for all my eyewear needs in the future. If you're in search of the perfect pair of glasses, look no further than Warby Parker, where exceptional service by Mary awaits.",

                    "review_text": "This is my first experience with online eyeglasses shopping and I love the Warby Parker experience. First of all, choosing lenses was enhanced by virtual try-on, which encouraged and taught me what shapes worked best for my face. Second, the free option to try on five frames at home allowed me to narrow down the choices even further.  Instructions that came with the frames gave me more information on how to judge which ones were best for my face.  I was able to decide between regular lenses in one pair, plus Rx sunglasses, or else clear lenses with transition darkening. I chose the latter.  Then, it was so easy to return the frames. Note, in my town, the USPS carriers won’t pick up parcels from homes, if they are not scheduled beforehand, but it was easy to drop off at the PO. \nNext step, ordering was easy, because I could send a photo of my prescription that I took with my phone. The order was completed with only one extra step because the PD, pupillary distance, was unclear on the copy of the Rx that I had. I could do that step with my phone, though. I was delighted that they were able to connect with my vision insurance immediately, even though my coverage was so new I didn’t even have my ID card yet. I paid through PayPal, again easy. Finally, communication with them by email and online was clear, swift, easy, and professional. I heard by email each step of the way. Shipping was swift and tracking steps were announced. The glasses arrived safely and work very well. I bought elsewhere some polarized sunglasses that fit over these, because the transition ones darken only before getting in the car, but those other ones work even better over them inside the car glass. I’m having the best of all options for me this way, rather than separate eyeglasses and Rx sunglasses to carry around.  The glasses look good, as well. Learning to use the new Rx, putting the extra car shades over top didn’t take long to get used to. I can see so well with these that I’ll use the Warby Parker service gladly in the future and will recommend it highly.",

They were even able to get me in for a quick eye exam For glasses and contacts.   The frame assortment was great!   I even got my glasses delivered to the store within a week.\nThat’s the good.\nNow the bad….\nMy husbands glasses never arrived.   The order was canceled.   I was notified they were ordered but never a notice that they were canceled.   When I picked up my glasses, I inquired about his status and that’s when I found out the order was cancelled.   A few days later, someone from the store called to ask who canceled the order and basically accused us of doing the canceling which was far from the truth.\nOn top of this, my trial pair of day contacts gave me a lot of issues.   I was unable to get the contacts out and had to sleep with them.   I woke up with tremendous eye pain.   And even though I contacted customer service the night before about my issue, I was told that there would be an optician who could help me out.   Being it was Fourth of July, I was relieved to hear this.   I went into the store and the optician was concerned that I might have scratched my eye and wasn’t comfortable touching my eye.   So I had to pay $100 to go to an opticians office to get seen.\nI never received a call from the Waterford store to follow up on me, nor have I received a call from their optometrist who had said they were going to order me contacts that might be a better fit.\nSo in conclusion, the store is nice, the personnel are friendly, the selection is good, back office is horrible and do not recommend optician services.

                    "review_text": "I purchased a pair of prescription Braden sunglasses with progressive lenses.  I bought them because I liked the frames, I wanted a pair of sunglasses to leave at my summer home and, for prescription sunglasses, the price was very reasonable.  I brought them to my summer home and when I wore them for the first time, I noticed that there was quite a lot of glare bouncing off the inside of the lenses into my eyes from any light source behind or above me.  The glare was so intense that I simply couldn't wear the glasses, as the light seemed more intense with them than without them.  Unfortunately, at the time I noticed this, I was at my country home, 90 miles away from the nearest Warby Parker store and 1800 miles away from my home in Texas.  When I returned to my home in Texas, I brought the glasses back to a nearby Warby Parker store.  I told the salesperson that I thought that someone had forgotten to put an anti-glare coating on the back of the lenses.  He tried the glasses on and, based on the intense light reflected off the inside of the lenses from the display lights in the store, agreed with me and agreed to replace the lenses.  A few weeks later I was notified that new lenses in a new Braden frame had arrived at the store.  When I tried on the new pair of prescription Braden sunglasses, the same glare problem existed.  The glasses were simply unwearable.  At that time, another salesperson explained to me that Warby Parker does not put an anti-glare coating on the inside of its sunglass lenses!  The absence of such a coating completely defeats the purpose of sunglasses.   If that is true, and based upon my experience I have no reason to believe it's not, I strongly recommend not buying sunglasses from Warby Parker.  By the way, I was told that there is nothing further that Warby Parker can do for me and that no refund would be forthcoming.",

I have trouble making a decision and they were patient and I never felt any pressure to purchase.  When I received my sunglasses, I realized that I had made a mistake and purchased a frame that was way too big for my face (my fault). They happily exchanged it for another frame.

In fact, I had no documenation of the purchase until the glasses arrived via mail.  Additionally, one pair of the glasses wasn't even my prescription.  I had to take more time out day to visit the Legacy Place, Dedham, MA location to return and reorder the glasses.  Once I had all correct three pairs in hand, I went back to the Legacy Place location to be fitted and was told I'd have to be put my name on a lengthly wait list.

Wide frames tend to look massive on my face.  I still have another Warby Parker from about 6 years ago - it's a rectangular shape, while the Waller is oval - but not overly oval - so perfect for what I wanted.   The try on program is great.  My old WP frames are still in excellent condition, other than some wear on the inside of the arm where the name and dimensions are slightly faded from moisture - they basically look new.  Yes they have fallen on the patio/tile, in the pool and no issues at all.  This speaks to the quality.  WP seems to hit the sweet spot for sunglasses in terms of price/quality at $95 for most.  Drugstore or some other online glasses range say $10-$40 but they either feel cheap or if you find one that seems decent initially out of the box - the quality isn't there and it will end up cracking, breaking, bending, screws coming loose etc. and it's not really worth getting.  The next price level for some of your various name brand sunglasses run from say $150-$225 significantly more than WP.  I would say WP can mostly stand shoulder to shoulder with them in terms of quality, design, look.  Try WP, make the comparisons yourself, you won't be disappointed.",

My first thought was that maybe I needed a new eye exam and prescription,  but my current glasses are off that prescription and I see great with them. I booked an appointment at my local Warby Parker, took the sunglasses with me. I received y eye exam and was told the glasses were not made correctly to the prescription.  I had to re order my glasses, wait another 10 days until I finally received them. I do like the sunglasses, but this experience was not what I expected.",

I see great with them (it's a new prescription), I haven't had to make any adjustments, the frame is beautiful. Customer service was great too, I had to replace the prescription I initially gave them and they were very flexible and accommodating. I've bought the last 2 frames from Warby Parker (and had the glasses done by a brick-and-mortar) but I think I'll just have them do the whole thing again next time.

Got another exam by a different doctor and it was a different prescription bordered 2 pair of the new prescription and when they came in they were a little better but my far vision wasn’t clear. So I set up a vision exam at a different company and it took 3 times as long as these at Warby Parker and it was a completely different prescription. I brought back the 2 pair of glasses and got a refund for glasses but not for exam.",

All 3 frames I chose were well made. I am near sighted. As a 74 year old, I have worn glasses for many years. The vision was spot on. However, I believe the lenses are much thicker than I previously wore. Perhaps there in lays the savings.  To my issue: I would prefer a few more Narrow or Medium size frames for my petite face. I love the coverage for sunglasses, but would like more options. \nThat said, I  am very happy with Warby Parker.",

                    "review_text": "I purchased a pair of prescription Braden sunglasses with progressive lenses.  I bought them because I liked the frames, I wanted a pair of sunglasses to leave at my summer home and, for prescription sunglasses, the price was very reasonable.  I brought them to my summer home and when I wore them for the first time, I noticed that there was quite a lot of glare bouncing off the inside of the lenses into my eyes from any light source behind or above me.  The glare was so intense that I simply couldn't wear the glasses, as the light seemed more intense with them than without them.  Unfortunately, at the time I noticed this, I was at my country home, 90 miles away from the nearest Warby Parker store and 1800 miles away from my home in Texas.  When I returned to my home in Texas, I brought the glasses back to a nearby Warby Parker store.  I told the salesperson that I thought that someone had forgotten to put an anti-glare coating on the back of the lenses.  He tried the glasses on and, based on the intense light reflected off the inside of the lenses from the display lights in the store, agreed with me and agreed to replace the lenses.  A few weeks later I was notified that new lenses in a new Braden frame had arrived at the store.  When I tried on the new pair of prescription Braden sunglasses, the same glare problem existed.  The glasses were simply unwearable.  At that time, another salesperson explained to me that Warby Parker does not put an anti-glare coating on the inside of its sunglass lenses!  The absence of such a coating completely defeats the purpose of sunglasses.   If that is true, and based upon my experience I have no reason to believe it's not, I strongly recommend not buying sunglasses from Warby Parker.  By the way, I was told that there is nothing further that Warby Parker can do for me and that no refund would be forthcoming.",

I told the employee that they don’t fit my head and said that’s ok we have someone hear who fit them to exactly the way you want them. I was skeptical at first, but said OK. I paid for the glasses, which was a very good price and the guy over to fit them to my needs. Which surprisingly was very quick, and once he was done, they fit exactly how I wanted them. I was very happy with the overall experience and prices. The worst part about it was me losing the sunglasses a week later, which had nothing to do with them.
